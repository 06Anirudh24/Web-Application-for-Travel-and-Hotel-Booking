# Web-Application-for-Travel-and-Hotel-Booking
The goal of this project is to build a web-application (with focus on the back-end rather than the front-end) to enable users to plan holidays by booking travel and accomodation tickets. The web-application is Python-based and the relational tables are constructed in BCNF form.
